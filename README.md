*A hashing/linked list assignment*

Essentially this is just a hash map using chaining for
collision resolution. The User Id Management
System (UIMS) keeps track of registered userIds and stores
them in a hash map.

I decided to try out an organizational scheme I found online
for mocking an object oriented interface with C. It felt
cheesy and unnatural.
